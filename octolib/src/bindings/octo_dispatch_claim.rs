/// Dispatch claims wrap the dispatch information of claims.
///
/// Dispatch information is needed every time that an iLet is submitted to the
/// system.  Normally, dispatch information is given implicitly through the use
/// of a claim_t or proxy_claim_t. However, there are some instances where these
/// objects aren't available. in these cases it is possilble to extract the pure
/// dispatch information of claim in the form of a dispatch claim.
///
/// The only meaningful operation possible on a dispatch claim is infect (+ DMA
/// transfers which, from a control-flow perspective, are just rather fancy
/// infect calls)
