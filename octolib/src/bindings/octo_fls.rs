/// Fibre-local-storage functions.
///
/// "Fibre" is another name for an i-let in execution. Fibre-local storage
/// enables the programmer to store small amounts of data (usually pointers) in a
/// memory area whose lifespan is identical to the lifespan of the fibre. The
/// values are preserved across blocking operations.
///
/// The programming interface is very similar to the Windows API.
///
/// Fibre-local storage supersedes the old "i-let-local data" interface, which
/// has imprecise semantics and is awkward to use by more than one program
/// component.
